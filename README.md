Manage people, aircrafts, simulators, gliders, types, airports, flights, simulations, glides.

Powerful and reactive database, based on Realm : search all activities, or only flights, glides, or simulations.

Follow your number of take-offs, landings, and IFR approaches, to comply with recent experience requirements.

Keep track of your D0, A0, and number of PAX.

Automatic totals generation: Overhaul, yearly or monthly totals, by activity. You can also define a custom period for totals generation.

Visualize your flight time limitations at a glance (for 30 days, 90 days, and 1 year).
